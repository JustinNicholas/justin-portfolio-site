            <br />
            <p className='no-margin-header'>From an Account manager in the print industry to a Software Engineer in the tech industry. At first glance, there is zero overlap. However, there is one major point of overlap, knowing how to communicate with industry jargon to colleagues and being able to translate that to layman's terms is necessary in both roles.</p>
            <br />
            <p className='no-margin-header'>In my previous role, I was a middle man between customers and production teams. I would get orders from people who know nothing about printing and pass that off to people with 20 years of experience. In my years of experience, I learned how to explain things to people with no knowledge and ask clarifying questions from production teams in terms that customers can understand.</p>
            <br />
            <p className='no-margin-header'>I'm very excited to be in this industry and I'm looking for the right company to get a great start!</p>
